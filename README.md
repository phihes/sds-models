# sds-models
A small framework to create and validate different models of user judgments that were provided during the interaction with a spoken dialog system. The focus lies on sequential modeling with Markov chains. The framework provides the setup of one or a series of experiments that involve the creation of models with certain parameters, model validation and performance metrics.
